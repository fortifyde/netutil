**Project Overview:**

My project, **NetUtil**, is a Go-based network utility tool used for vulnerability assessments. It features network configuration, monitoring, and analysis capabilities, leveraging tools like Wireshark and tshark. The tool operates via a text-based UI (using the `tview` library) and is primarily designed to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time, focusing on identifying unencrypted protocols, VLAN IDs, weak SSL/TLS implementations, and unusual network activity. 

**Structure:**
- Modular codebase with directories for UI (`internal/ui`), network functions (e.g., capturing traffic, toggling interfaces in `internal/functions`), and parsers for traffic analysis in `internal/functions/parsers` (e.g., parser registry, VLAN, protocol distribution).
- Real-time feedback via UI modals for errors and notifications.
- Planned enhancements include network discovery, detailed port scanning, and device configuration backups.

**Key Concerns:**
- The tool needs to run with root access, so security (input sanitization, safe execution) is critical.
- Code efficiency, modularity, and extensibility are priorities.
